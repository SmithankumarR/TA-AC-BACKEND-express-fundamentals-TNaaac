                        The Solar System is made up of the Sun and all of the smaller objects that move around it. Apart
                        from the Sun, the largest members of the Solar System are the eight major planets. Nearest the
                        Sun are four fairly small, rocky planets - Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond Mars is the asteroid belt ‚Äì a region populated by millions of rocky objects. These are
                        left-overs from the formation of the planets, 4.5 billion years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the far side of the asteroid belt are the four gas giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
                        Neptune. These planets are much bigger than Earth, but very lightweight for their size. They are
                        mostly made of hydrogen and helium.
                    </p>
                    <p>Until recently, the furthest known planet was an icy world called Pluto. However, Pluto is
                        dwarfed by Earth‚Äôs Moon and many astronomers think it is too small to be called a true planet.

                    </p>
                    <p>An object named Eris, which is at least as big as Pluto, was discovered very far from the Sun in
                        2005. More than 1,000 icy worlds such as Eris have been discovered beyond Pluto in recent years.
                        These are called Kuiper Belt Objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided that
                        Pluto and Eris must be classed as ‚Äúdwarf planets‚Äù.

                    </p>
                    <p>Even further out are the comets of the Oort Cloud. These are so far away that they are invisible
                        in even the largest telescopes. Every so often one of these comets is disturbed and heads
                        towards the Sun. It then becomes visible in the night sky.</p>
